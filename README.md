# notice of deprecation

This project itself is complete, however I have archived the unfinished interpreter for simple as I do not feel ready to finish it.

# language-simple package

This page contains syntax highlighting for the made up programming language simple. The correct file extension for simple files is .smpl\
Documentation for simple, as well as a work in progress interpreter for it is on my github page.
